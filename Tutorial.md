# Tutorial: Analyze Common Performance Bottlenecks with IntelÂ® VTuneTMProfiler - C++ Sample Code (Linux* OS)

1. Run Analysis Performance Snapshot

- the goal of performance optimization is to get the highest possible performance gain with the least possible investment of time and effort.
- highlighting the main problem areas in your application and providing metrics to estimate their severity.
- focus on the most acute problems, solving which can yield the highest performance gain.
- offers other analysis types for deeper investigation into each performance problem.

2. Interpret Result Data Performance Snapshot

- The Performance Snapshot result Summary tab shows the following:
	- Analysis tree
	- Metrics Panes
	- Collection and Platform Info

- Identify Problem Areas

3. Run Analysis and Interpret Hotspots
- Interpret Hotspots Result Data
- Identify Most Time-Consuming Code Areas

4. Analyze Memory Access
- Run Memory Access Analysis
- Interpret Memory Access Data

5. Resolve Memory Access Issue

6. Analyze Optimization After Performance

7. Analyze Vectorization Efficiency

| 1. | Find the Bottleneck                     | You used the Performance Snapshot, Hotspots, and Memory Access analysis types to determine the main bottleneck that limits application performance. 
You started with Performance Snapshot to determine main limiting factors and next steps for optimization:
- Using the Hotspots analysis to isolate problem to specific code area.
- Using the Memory Access analysis to understand the exact mechanics behind the bottleneck.
