# Tutorial: Analyze Common Performance Bottlenecks with Intel® VTuneTMProfiler - C++ Sample Code (Linux* OS)

## Workflow

1. Run Analysis Performance Snapshot (ps)

**The goal of performance optimization is to get the highest possible performance gain with the least possible investment of time and effort.**

### Why run PS?
1. Highlighting the main problem areas in your application and providing metrics to estimate their severity.
2. Focus on the most acute problems, solving which can yield the highest performance gain.

<!--### How to run PS?-->
<!--1. Start (Intel® VTuneTMProfiler)[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-standalone-components.html#vtune] -- GUI-->

<!--```-->
